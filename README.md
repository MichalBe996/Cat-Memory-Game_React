# Cat-Memory-Game_React

Memory game coded with React.js. I'm pretty content with how this program turned out, except for importing of images - I couldn't figure out the way
to do it in shorter way, therefore I had to import every single image one by one. Every clicked image disappears and new one is uploaded. If image has not been clicked before, player points increment by one. On the other hand, if player clicks image that has been clicked before, player points go down to zero, player best updated if
it was actually his best result and game starts from the beginning.
